# Movies-ETL

Perform the Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) process to create a data pipeline on movie datasets using Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook and PostgreSQL.

This project was an introduction ot the EXTRACT, TRANSFORM, and LOAD process. Movie data from Wikipedia, Kaggle, and aggregated ratings was used to assemble a movie database from a clean dataset for a fictional hackathon. The ETL process was used to extract the Wikipedia and Kaggle data from their respective files, transform the datasets by cleaning rows and formating datatypes, preforming joins, and load the cleaned dataset into a SQL database.
